# What is Gandalf?
In short, Gandalf is a project that does everything that makes organising and managing an event a lot easier for FK-clubs of the University of Ghent. The application is written specifically for the UGent FakulteitenKonvent. It allows students to register for events and it also interacts with the FK-Enrolment database and allows members of student unions to subscribe to member-only events from their clubs.
